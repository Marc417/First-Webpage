<h2 style="color:red;"> What is Coding?</h2>
<br>
<p style="color:white;">Every software on an electronic device uses code to function and define the different features.There are many different coding languages that work differently, it is a way for anyone to create a service or website with command lines. It is converting text into a conveniant readable format such as a website, for other people to use.</p>

<h3 id="red"> Why I think knowing how to code is important</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Knowing how to code can be very useful for creating services, websites or selling stuff oneline. It allows you to always be able to create or test new things, and understand programs other people have made and maybe even improve on them. It therefore offers a lot of job opportunities if you know how to program well on many languages.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4"> <p style="color:white;">Many people agree that coding is a good thing to know how to do, for example, I found that Apple's <br> Co-founder Steve Jobs said â€œI think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer<br> because it teaches you how to think." <br>"It is applying mathematics sciences and testing for errors."</p></div>
</div>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;"> There are many different coding languages such as: </p>
    <ul style="color:white;">
   <li> Python         (used by Reddit, Instagram)</li>
    <li>Html            (Used for basic websites)</li>
    <li>JavaScript      (used by 90% of all websites)</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:white;"> And many more...</p>
    <p style="color:white;"> There are many reasons why people should know how to code, even if it doesn't interest you,>it may help you learn how to think differently. </p>
    <p style="color:white;"> You can share what you've created and see what other people made.  Coding is something I wanted to test and so now I am learning how to,
    And I think many other people should try it </p>
